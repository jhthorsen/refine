NAME
    Refine - Refine an instance with new methods

VERSION
    0.01

DESCRIPTION
    Refine is a module that export $_refine which can be used to add methods
    object instances. Each $_refine call on the object will create a new
    class with the new refined methods and rebless the instance into that
    class, which keeps the original class as it was.

    This is an EXPERIMENTAL release. The class generator might change in
    future releases.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make manifest
    make test
    make install

SYNOPSIS
      use Refine;
      use Data::Dumper ();

      my $obj = Some::Class->new;

      # add the dump() method to the $obj instance
      $obj->$_refine(
        dump => sub { Data::Dumper->new([$_[0])->Terse(1)->SortKeys(1)->Dump },
      );

OPTIONAL MODULES
    *   Sub::Name

        If you have Sub::Name installed, the methods will have proper names,
        instead of "__ANON__". This will make stacktraces easier to read.
